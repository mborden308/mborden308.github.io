        <p>One of the questions I always get asked is "How did you get into photography?". It's a great question but I
            never really have a great answer.
            <br>
            <br>
            Throughout high school and college, I've been around people always taking pictures, whether that be at cross
            country or track meets or senior photos. I guess after seeing the photos
            I always seemed to have a different vision for what I was expecting. When I was younger, I remember going on
            vacations with the family and seeing some amazing sights. I would
            always hold my hands up to create of box as in to frame a photo. It wasn't until after college that I
            finally decided this was a passion I was going to pursue.
            <br>
            <br>
            I bought a camera and immediatly started going out and about to shoot. I learned quickly that there was a
            lot I didn't know about the technical aspects of photography.
            I immediatly dove in to learn what every dial, knob, button and setting option was. I'm happy to say I'm
            still learning. There's so much! But it's a fun and challenging endevor.
