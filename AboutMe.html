                            One of the questions I always get asked is "How did you get into photography?".
                         Well I'm here to tell you in a couple hundred words that I have no idea.
                        </p>

                            I've always been interested in more creative projects. In high school, I took more art classes than gym classes. I didn't need gym, I already looked like a greek god and had a name that rhymed with Michael Jordan, i was set in sports. I tried painting, dabbled in ceramics but excelled at drawing. As college rolled around and I had a career that focused on the left side of the brain; I majored in marketing with an emphasis on analytics. I ran cross country and track which made me a year round college athlete. Again, I was set with athletics. I needed to feed the creative side of my brain. I volunteered to help my cross country coach create a year book to chronicle the times and memories for the year. It was here I started to find a love of photography.
                            <br>
                            I would ask runner and parents for their photos to include in the yearbook. I would get sent hundreds of photos and the best ones made the cut. I couldn't help but have the mindset that I could take better photos. I had thoughts for how I would take the photo differently or ideas for creative angles. Once I graduated and started having a generating a real income, I decided to put my money where I thougts were. On a Black Friday Deal I bought I Nikon D7000.

                            I knew I would enjoy taking photos and putting my own spin on it but I never realized how technical it was. This was a welcome surprise, I was able to tickle the right side of my brain but now I was able to also use the left side. This is a photo journal of my journey since I bought the camera and a few tales of the action. That's my story and I'm sticking to it. Enjoy!
