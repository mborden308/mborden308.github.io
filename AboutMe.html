                    <p>One of the questions I always get asked is "How did you get into photography?". It's a great
                        question but I
                        never really have a great answer.

                        Throughout high school and college, I've been around people always taking pictures, whether that
                        be at cross
                        country or track meets or senior photos. I guess after seeing the photos
                        I always seemed to have a different vision for what I was expecting. When I was younger, I
                        remember going on
                        vacations with the family and seeing some amazing sights. I would
                        always hold my hands up to create of box as in to frame a photo. It wasn't until after college
                        that I
                        finally decided this was a passion I was going to pursue.

                        I bought a camera and immediatly started going out and about to shoot. I learned quickly that
                        there was a
                        lot I didn't know about the technical aspects of photography.
                        I immediatly dove in to learn what every dial, knob, button and setting option was. I'm happy to
                        say I'm
                        still learning. There's so much! But it's a fun and challenging endevor.
